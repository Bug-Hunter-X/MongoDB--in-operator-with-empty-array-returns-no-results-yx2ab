# MongoDB $in operator with empty array returns no results
This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with an empty array.  The expected behavior is to return all documents, as an empty array effectively matches everything, but instead it returns no results. This can lead to unexpected behavior in applications relying on this query.

## Solution
The solution involves checking if the array used with `$in` is empty.  If it is, use a different approach, such as returning all documents.
